* Listen
** What is it?
The listen.sh is an OS X and Linux script that plays list of songs from your terminal
** Installation
The only thing you should do before start using the script is modify your configuration file 
which is in the conf/ directory.

There is two important configurations you should do:
  - SRC which defines the location of the music that you want to listen to.
  - Then you must write the name of the list or lists as a variable, and give it the value of the files 
    you want to assign to that list. Example:
   
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
SRC=H1CD1

U5="07..mp3 08..mp3"
#+END_SRC
   
** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Where arg1 is the name of the list
./listen.sh arg1  

# help command
./listen.sh -h
./listen.sh --help
#+END_SRC
